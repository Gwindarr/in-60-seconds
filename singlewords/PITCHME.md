### Finding the Tones in Thai
@ul
- Step one is to identify the CONSONANT CLASS of the word.
- The class of the INITIAL CONSONANT determines what class that word takes.
- There are 3 consonant classes each with its own rule set.

Consider the following word:
#### บ้าน - house/home 
@ul
- What's the initial consonant?
- บ is the initial consonant.
- บ is a middle class word because the initial consonant บ ใบไม้ is a middle class consonant.

### Tone Rules

The first rule for MIDDLE CLASS words is:
@ul
- Default Tone = MID 
  + Default Tone is when a word has no modifiers.  
  + There are 2 types of modifiers: @color[blue](TONE MARKS) and @color[red](HARD ENDINGS)

@ul
- The word for house/home in Thai, บ้าน has a modifier so it therefore cannot take on the default tone.  
- This word has the 2nd tone mark.  
- If you look carefullly, the 2nd tone mark is basically a stylized version of the number 2 which floats over the initial consonant.  
- บ้าน

What happens to a MIDDLE CLASS word when it has the 2nd tone mark?  
@ul
- As with any modifier, the 2nd tone mark changes the tone away from the default for that class.
- When a MIDDLE CLASS word has the 2nd tone mark, it becomes FALLING TONE. 
- บ้าน has a FALLING tone because it's a MIDDLE CLASS word and it has the 2nd tone mark as a modifier.

Now that we know 2 tone rules for Middle Class, let's look at some more examples using middle class words:
@ul
- What tones would the folloiwng words take?
- บ้าง (some)
  + Just like บ้าน, บ้าง is a falling tone because:
  + MIDDLE CLASS + 2nd TONE MARK = FALLING
- จาน (plate)
  + Does this word have any modifiers?
  + No.  No modifiers on a MIDDLE CLASS word gives you the DEFAULT tone for that class. 
  + What is the DEFAULT tone for MIDDLE CLASS?
  + MID

### Finding the Tones in Thai
@ul
- Step one is to identify the CONSONANT CLASS of the word.
- The class of the INITIAL CONSONANT determines what class that word takes.
- There are 3 consonant classes each with its own rule set.

Consider the following word:
#### บ้าน - house/home 
@ul
- What's the initial consonant?
- บ is the initial consonant.
- บ is a middle class word because the initial consonant บ ใบไม้ is a middle class consonant.

### Tone Rules

The first rule for MIDDLE CLASS words is:
@ul
- Default Tone = MID 
  + Default Tone is when a word has no modifiers.  
  + There are 2 types of modifiers: TONE MARKS and HARD ENDINGS

@ul
- The word for house/home in Thai, บ้าน has a modifier so it therefore cannot take on the default tone.  
- This word has the 2nd tone mark.  
- If you look carefullly, the 2nd tone mark is basically a stylized version of the number 2 which floats over the initial consonant.  
- บ้าน

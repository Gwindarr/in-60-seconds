### Finding the Tones in Thai
---
@ul
- First, we must identify the CONSONANT CLASS of the word.
- The class of the INITIAL CONSONANT determines what class that word takes.

Consider the following word:
####บ้าน - house/home 
@ul
- บ้าน 
- What's the initial consonant?
- บ is the initial consonant.
- บ is a middle class word because the initial consonant บ ใบไม้ is a middle class consonant.

###Tone Rules
Each consonant class has a separate set of tone rules.  It's necessary to learn the rules of each class to determine the tone. 
The rules for MIDDLE CLASS words are:
@ul
- Default Tone = MID 
+ Default Tone is when a word has no modifiers.  There are 2 types of modifiers: TONE MARKS and HARD ENDINGS
@ulend

The word for house/home in Thai has a modifier so it therefore cannot take on the default tone.  This word has the 2nd tone mark.  If you look carefullly, the 2nd tone mark is basically a stylized #2 which floats over the consonant it is modifying.
